  Brother: Yeah I got drugs from a local gang down the block in chambers st. There isn't much for me outside in the streets all I can do is try to get money to surivive for me and my family.
  Officer: How do I know you are telling me the truth sir? You could be lying for all I know.
  Brother: I know you will most likely not believe me, but I'm at the point of no return.  If I drop out of this, the gang will hunt me and my brother down.  I just wanted to do this shipment, collect the money, and move on.
  Officer: Well sir that is all the questions I have for you right now I'll be with you in a second.

    Officer: So (passes down drug in a bag) care to tell me why this was nearby with your brother when we arrested you?
    You: I had no idea my brother did this.  I took my biology test.  I had no buniness nor the desire to do this.  I didn't do anything wrong officer.
    Officer: Really now?  I just talked to your brother, and he told me you were in charge of everything, and your little test was nothing, but a false alibi.
    You: NO! Im telling you! I just finished my test, and headed back home to sleep. I'm sure my brother has a good reason for doing this.
    You: Regardless, I think he can't stop now, because now if he dares leave now, the gang will sure hunt him down. I don't know what to do.

  Officer: Then afterwards hopefully put your brother in a gang intervation program to stop this downward cycle.  I lost my son to gang violence, and I don't want to see you both die over nothing.
  Officer: I know you were forced son, but here I'll do my best to help you in this situation.
